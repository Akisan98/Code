### Task 1 - User-interaction

Our users can enter their symptom levels (ex. coughing, breathing pain, itchy eyes) in our app, using a sliding bar for each symptom. The levels are set to 1 to 10 in our database, where 1 is the best (e.g. no coughing) and 10 is the worst. We save the historical symptom entries for each user in our database. 

Suggest some ways of presenting the historical symptom data to a user, write up the suggestion or use your preferred sketch/design tool.

##### My Idea: 

I went for my preferred design tool Adobe XD where i made some mockups.
