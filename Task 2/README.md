### How to run:

You can run this mobile application by either using:

- Android Studio 3.5.1+
- Android Phone with Android 7+

### Custom Library or Elements

- Fluidslider by ramotion - https://github.com/Ramotion/fluid-slider-android

  This slider gives the user a visual feedback letting them know what number they are choosing, compared to the stock slider (SeekBar) which only seems to offer dots/markers as visual feedback which doesn't make it easy to know exactly which number it is without counting the dots. An added benefit is that Fluidslider looks a lot more modern and fresh.
